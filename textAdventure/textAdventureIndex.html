    <p>Hello and welcome to The Alpine Forest Text Adventure!</p>
    <p>The purpose of this game is to try to get to the end of the trail via several button options. You must choose the correct ones or start from the beggining!</p>
    <p>Currently the only issues I am facing with this game is lack of images and lack of optimization.</p>
    <p>I plan to add Jscript that will show a different image depending on different parts of the story. I also plan to research ways to streamline Jscript so there isn't as much code bloat. </p>
    <p>For future versions of the game I hope to add an inventory system, more puzzles, music, and images to each scene.</p>
